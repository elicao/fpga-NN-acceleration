# E315: Digital Design with FPGAs
## Project X: accelerating neural network on a Xilinx FPGA
The code is programmed for the [Digilent PYNQ-Z1](https://store.digilentinc.com/pynq-z1-python-productivity-for-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc/).
 - Project_X_V6/ holds the jupyter notebooks for training and running the NN prediction. This code was largely not
written by me, except [Inference_Large.ipynb](https://github.com/tjzhang1/fpga-NN-acceleration/blob/master/Project_X_V6/Project_X/Inference_Large.ipynb) and the [verilog/](https://github.com/tjzhang1/fpga-NN-acceleration/blob/master/Project_X_V6/Project_X/verilog) folder.
 - vivado_project/ holds the vivado project used to generate the bitstream for the PYNQ-Z1 board.
 - report.pdf has a thorough explanation of my steps and logic to approaching the project.
